# GroBot - AI-Powered Plant Caretaker
TigerHacks 2024

GroBot is an AI-powered assistant that helps plant parents, such as myself, provide better care for their plants. It has a chatbot specific to this use case. GroBot also has a feature to assess the health of plants, identify any diseases, and suggest treatments and nutrients that may be beneficial.

I started this project at TigerHacks 2024 during my junior year as a CS student and budding coder.

Note: I have all the components running, including the UI and chatbot, the integration of these two is a work-in-progress as of now.
